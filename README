Herwith you will find some tools and utilities I have been working on and/or using for years as well as some stuff I wanted to be visible to the web for one reason and another (such as my http://perlmonks.org css file).

Poke around to your hearts content and don't blame me if you get bored :-)

Some of the utilities have their provenance elsewhere, I have tried to credit
them as applicable in the files.  I am eternally grateful to the bright minds
who have come before me and make it easy for a hack like me to get his job
done and create useful if not clever tools.
